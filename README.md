# Milky Way mass

This repository contains data and results from our recent paper "A robust estimate of the Milky Way mass from the rotation curve".

### Brief Description

**Karukes et al. in prep.** estimates the total mass of the Milky Way (MW), based on the use of tracers of the circular velocity in the disk plane along with stars in the stellar halo and the reconstruction of an underlying dark matter (DM) profile. The MW halo mass is added to the total stellar mass, estimated through the stellar surface density and microlesing measurements.

### Content

- `results/` - contains the cumulative profile for the total and DM masses as a function of galactocentric distance
- `data/` - contains mass estimates taken from the literature (please see **Karukes et al. in prep.** for references)
- `figs/` - contains figures
